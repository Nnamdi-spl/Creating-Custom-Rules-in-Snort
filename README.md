Snort is an open source network intrusion prevention system, capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet
 logging on IP networks. It can perform protocol analysis, content searching/matching, and can be used to detect a variety
 of attacks and probes, such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much more
In this project,we are going to write some custom  rules for detecting  Nmap and icmp echo traffic through the network using Snort.`
